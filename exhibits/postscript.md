After six hours of continual crisis, Apollo 13 is now safely back on a trajectory towards Earth, with a stable configuration and no immediate dangers. The Command Module is completely dark, and the crew is preparing to bring Aquarius down to a minimal state. It would eventually transpire, after some on-board experimentation with different solutions, that because of the added cost of the inverter required to keep the navigation eight-ball running, it was cheaper in total to leave the whole PGNS system running in Attitude Hold mode to prevent gimbal lock rather than having the crew watch the drift manually. For thermal control, the crew were simply instructed every so often to manually move the stack around to different attitudes.

Following the PC+2 past the far side of the Moon, even Aquarius would be powered down completely apart from COMM and life support, in order to conserve power. When a final midcourse correction was required after this, the infamous manual burn dramatized in the film was performed, as power could not be spared to power up the entire computer system.

Over the next many hours and days, many more problems need to be solved: the LiOH canisters mentioned briefly by Glynn Lunney deplete, and a makeshift adapter has to be fashioned for spares from the Command Module to be used in order to prevent a buildup of carbon dioxide; extensive resource planning is done to stretch consumables far past their designed limit; the crew deals with hypothermic conditions and dangerously scant water rations while demanding tasks continue to be required; an entirely new hours-long Command Module power-up procedure must be developed, tested, and successfully read over voice to an exhausted Jack Swigert to ensure a successful re-entry, a process that by all rights should take weeks rather than days.

Hopefully, you have not only enjoyed these six hours of audio, but as well gained a new appreciation and tactile understanding of what it was like to hurl Apollo through the heavens.
