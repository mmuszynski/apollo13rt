Overview
--------

Apollo 13 Real-time is an interactive experience featuring the audio from the Flight Director's Loop and the Air-Ground Loop. This audio was generously made available online through the efforts of [John Stoll](https://archive.org/details/Apollo13Audio) of NASA Johnson. The first six hours following the accident are available. In addition to the audio, each loop has been transcribed and will play automatically alongside what you hear. Finally, the interactive glossary and this exhibits section should provide enough context for any interested layperson with some memory of basic secondary school physics to be able to understand what's going on.

The Loops
---------

The Flight Director's Loop is a rare gem. Mission Control was wired with numerous audio loops, which you can think of as internal radio channels. Each Flight Controller had their own loop, one for every station you see in the Mission Control Room, which connected them to a back room of their peers who could help them spot, diagnose, and solve problems. The most important, however, was the Flight Director's Loop, to which everybody listened and upon which the most critical questions and decisions were raised and made.

The Air-Ground Loop audio is the actual radio link between Houston and the Apollo spacecraft. With rare exception, only CAPCOM, typically themself an astronaut, was allowed to speak to the astronauts. You will hear decisions get made on the Flight Director's Loop and subsequently passed up on the Air-Ground Loop.

The Exhibits
------------

Copious reference material is provided here. If you are brand-new to Apollo, browsing through the Primer section is highly-recommended. The Overview section provides a somewhat deeper look at various aspects of flying Apollo to the Moon, and will prove helpful if you get stuck understanding the relationship between technical terms and systems while listening to the audio. The Reference Manual section provides even further detail on particular technical subsystems, for those who are interested in understanding exactly what the various switches and valves controlled.

Creating Installations
----------------------

It is easy to create a kiosk installation of this application, which adjusts the layout for optimal full-screen display on a television, or presents only the exhibit and reference material. For more information, see [the readme](https://github.com/issa-tseng/apollo13rt#kiosk-modes).
