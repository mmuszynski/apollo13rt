Roger. Sounds good. And this is the crew of Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening, and we're just about ready to close out our inspection of Aquarius and get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey. Good night.

CAPCOM
Thank you, 13.

55:48:40
CAPCOM
Apollo 13, Houston. The next thing we'd like you to do is to -

CMP
Go ahead.

CAPCOM
- we'd like you to roll right to 060 and null your rates for photography of the Comet Bennett. To do that, we would like you to enable quads C and D. For the maneuver, use all your quads. And in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to terminate the battery charge on battery B. One other request, we'd like to have you verify -

55:49:13
CMP
Okay. Will do.

CAPCOM
One other request, we'd like you to verify your high gain configuration. We'd like to know what track mode, what SERVO, and what BEAM WIDTH.

CMP
Okay, Jack. During the TV we were AUTO TRACK, NARROW BEAM WIDTH, and the PRIMARY ELECTRONICS. And we had a good lockup. Just after we started the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength, and it just seemed that right there at about 239° in yaw, that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to 0 and pitch would go to 90.

55:50:05
CAPCOM
Roger. We copy, and the TV show was great.

CMP
Okay, real fine. Okay, I'm going to maneuver to 060, 090, and 0.

CAPCOM
And 13, we'd like you to check C-4 thruster.

55:51:34
CMP
Okay, Jack. The battery charge has been terminated on battery B.

CAPCOM
Roger. We see it, Jack. And we've got a reading of -2° on the docking index. We'd like to know if that's 2.0 precise or if it's 2.1 or 1.9.

CMP
No. It's -2.0 precisely.

CAPCOM
Thank you.

55:52:59
CAPCOM
13, we've got one more item for you, when you get a chance. We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks. In addition, I have shaft and trunnion -

CMP
Okay. Standby.

55:55:20
LMP
Okay, Houston -

CDR
I believe we've had a problem here.

CAPCOM
This is Houston. Say again, please.

CDR
Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a MAIN B BUS UNDERVOLT.

CAPCOM
Roger. MAIN B UNDERVOLT.

CAPCOM
Okay, standby, 13. We're looking at it.

55:56:10
LMP
Okay. Right now, Houston the voltage is looking good. And we had a pretty large bang associated with the CAUTION AND WARNING there. And as I recall, MAIN B was the one that had an amp spike on it once before.

CAPCOM
Roger, Fred.

LMP
In the interim here, we're starting to go ahead and button up the tunnel again.

55:57:01
CAPCOM
Roger.

LMP
Yes. That jolt must have rocked the sensor on - I see now - O₂ QUANTITY 2; it was oscillating down around 20 to 60 percent. Now it's full-scale high again.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CDR
And Houston, we had a RESTART on our computer. We have PGNCS light and RESTART RESET.

CAPCOM
Roger. RESTART and a PGNCS light. RESTART and a PNGCS RESET -

CDR
Okay. And we're looking at our SERVICE MODULE RCS HELIUM 1, we have B is barber poled and D is barber poled. HELIUM 2, D is barber pole. And SECONDARY PROPELLANTS I have A and C barber pole. BMAG temperatures -

55:58:07
LMP
Okay, AC 2 is showing zip. I'm going to try to reconfigure on that, Jack.

CAPCOM
Roger.

LMP
We got a MAIN BUS A UNDERVOLT now too, showing.

CAPCOM
Standby 1, Jim.

56:00:34
CAPCOM
13, Houston. We'd like you to attempt to reconnect fuel cell 1 to MAIN A and fuel cell 3 to MAIN B. Verify that quad Delta is open.

LMP
Okay, Houston. I'm showing - I tried to reset and fuel cell 1 and 3 are both showing grey flags, but they're both showing zip on the flows.

56:01:08
CAPCOM
We copy.

56:03:17
LMP
Okay, Houston. Are you still reading - 13?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative, we're reading you. We're trying to come up with some good ideas here for you.

LMP
Okay. Let me give you some readings - in the interim to help MAIN A voltage, Jack. I've got BUS TIE AC on.

CAPCOM
Say again, Fred.

LMP
In the interim, to help out MAIN A voltage, I've got MAIN BUS TIE BAT A/C on. Or would you rather accept the 25 volts we are seeing on MAIN A?

CAPCOM
Okay. BUS TIE A/C on.

56:04:10
CAPCOM
13, Houston. We need OMNI Charlie, please.

LMP
You got it.

56:05:32
CAPCOM
13, Houston. We'd like you to verify couple of readings for us. We would like the nitrogen pressure on fuel cell 1. We need the oxygen pressure on fuel cell 2.

LMP
Okay. Nitrogen on 1 and oxygen on 2. Is that correct?

CAPCOM
Negative. Oxygen on 3.

LMP
Okay.

56:06:23
LMP
Okay. The systems test 1-A says zip.

LMP
And 2 Baker, which is 3 oxygen, says 0.6.

CAPCOM
2 Baker says 0.6, and say again the other one.

LMP
Fuel cell 1 nitrogen reads 0.

56:07:01
CAPCOM
Roger, 0.

56:08:46
CAPCOM
13, Houston. We'd like you to open-circuit FUEL CELL 1. Leave 2 and 3 as-is.

LMP
Okay. I'll get to work on that.

CDR
And Jack, our O₂ QUANTITY number 2 tank is reading 0. Did you get that?

56:09:04
CAPCOM
O₂ QUANTITY number 2 is 0.

CDR
That's AC, okay. Yeah, that's because of AC and it looks to me, looking out the hatch, that we are venting something. We are venting something out into the - into space.

CAPCOM
Roger. We copy your venting.

CDR
It's a gas of some sort.

LMP
Okay, FUEL CELL 1 you just wanted it off the line now, Jack, is that right?

CAPCOM
We just wanted you to open the circuit on fuel cell 1.

LMP
Okay, she's off the line.

56:12:48
CAPCOM
13, Houston. We see you getting close to gimbal lock there. We'd like you to bring up all quad Cs on MAIN A, quad C-l, C-2, C-3, C-4 on MAIN A, and also bring B-3 and B-4 up on MAIN A.

56:13:15
CAPCOM
13, Houston. Do you read?

LMP
Yes. No, we got it.

CDR
Affirm.

CAPCOM
Okay. Can you tell us anything about the venting: where it's coming from, what window you see it at?

LMP
It's coming out of window 1 right now, Jack, and could you give me the thrusters again?

CAPCOM
Okay, the thrusters -

LMP
What buses?

CAPCOM
We'd like - on MAIN A, we'd like Charlie 1, 2, 3, and 4. Also Bravo 3 and 4 on MAIN A.

CAPCOM
Roger. We copy BMAG 2 in WARM UP. We'll follow you through.

CMP
Okay, and something is giving us some rates, Jack, both in pitch and roll, so I'm suspecting that maybe it's whatever it is that's venting back there. I've had to use DIRECT in order to stabilize this, and as soon as I do, we're starting to pick up rates again. Can you pick up any jets firing?  

CAPCOM
Standby.

CAPCOM
What direction are your rates in, Jack?

56:23:06
CMP
It's negative pitch and negative roll.

CMP
I'm going to try and hold 0, 180, and 0.

56:49:08
CDR
Okay, Houston. The center panel - I'm looking at the RCS indicator A. We have a package temperature of 180. Our helium pressure is 3900. I'm looking at fuel pressure of about 180 and percentage of about, I'd say 85%.

CDR
B is about the same, except that that package pressure is 190. On Quad C, we're looking about the same, except that the package temperature is 100. On Quad D, we're looking at package temperature of 160. All other indications are about the same.

On the SPS side of the house, the temperature is 72°, helium's reading 3500; N₂ A is reading 2300; N₂ B about 2450. And our ullage pressures: FUEL is reading about 165; OXIDIZER 170.

LMP
Fuel cells: FUEL CELL 1, both CLOSED, they're zip; SKIN TEMP 405°; CONDENSER EXHAUST is lower scale. FUEL CELL 2 - right now we've got an O₂ - an H₂ FLOW reading of 0.13 to 0.14, and the O₂ FLOW is right now pegged full scale high although it has been varying depending on thruster activity which has also given us MAIN BUS A undervolts from a steady reading of about 1.1 up to full scale high.

56:55:33
LMP
The T-SKIN is about 445 and the CONDENSOR EXHAUST 17, correction, 180. Let's see if you want it on the DC indicator: FUEL CELL 1 is 0 amps; 2 is reading somewhere between 44 and about - oscillating 44 to 48, again depending on thruster activity.

Yeah, that's what we're thinking about too. You want me to do a quick P52? It kind of looks like - we've been talking it over, and it kind of looks like we'd probably align our plats - LM platform with our platform and then power down the CM, and keep the LM powered up doing a DPS - whatever DPS burns you give us?

CAPCOM
13, we're not going to concern ourselves at the moment with a DPS burn; it's going to be some time before we'd get to that. But we're working on other procedures to give you, which will allow us to use the LM systems. Over.

57:25:13
CMP
Okay. Real fine.

57:26:41
CAPCOM
Apollo 13, Houston. We'd like to charge BATTERY A now.

CDR
Charge BATTERY A. Roger.

57:27:13
CAPCOM
And Jack, in regard to your question about the P52 and LM platform, it's - there's no need to worry about that now. We wouldn't be using the LM platform for - until about 79 hours, so let's go as-is on the platform for now. Over.

CDR
Okay. We understand.

CMP
Okay, Jack.

57:30:14
CMP
And Jack, we've turned off the waste dump heater. If you're going to consider dumping any more waste water, we probably ought to do it while the duct is warm there.

CAPCOM
Roger. Standby, Jack.

CMP
Okay.

CAPCOM
Okay Jack, let's keep the water; no need for a dump right now.

CMP
Alright.

57:32:16
CAPCOM
13, Houston. We see the PROP ISOL valve on RCS Quad Charlie closed, so we'd like to also disable AUTO RCS feature in Quad Charlie.

CDR
You want us to isolate the AUTO RCS features in Quad Charlie?

CAPCOM
Affirmative.

CDR
Okay Jack, I didn't plan to reset that Quad Charlie PROP ISOL valve. Do you want me to do that?

CDR
Okay, we just tried it and Quad Alpha and Charlie barber poles are showing.

57:33:02
CAPCOM
Standby, Jim.

CMP
Okay, Jack. That's the secondary propellant are barber poles on Alpha and Charlie.

57:34:47
CAPCOM
13, Houston. It won't do any good to try to power the propellant valves on A and C, so we want you to disable the AUTO on RCS Charlie. And we have a procedure for getting power from the LM we'd like you to copy down.

57:35:09
CMP
Okay.

CDR
Standby, Jack.

CMP
That sounds like good news.

57:36:06
LMP
Okay, Jack, about how long is it?

CAPCOM
It's not a very long procedure, Fred. We figure we've got about 15 minutes' worth of power left in the Command Module, so we want you to start getting over in the LM and getting some power on that. And you ready to copy your procedure?

LMP
Okay.

CAPCOM
Okay, in the CSM -

LMP
Standby.

LMP
Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay. In the CSM on panel 5, circuit breakers LM POWER 1 and 2, OPEN. Then LM POWER switch, reset and release. In the LM, on panel 11 and panel 16, XLUNAR BUS TIE, both circuit breakers CLOSE. On panel 16, circuit breaker ASCENT ECA CONTROL, CLOSE. On 16, DESCENT ECA CONTROL, CLOSE. On panel 14, put your BAT 5 NORMAL feed ON. BATs 1, 2, 3, and 4 LOW VOLTAGE taps, ON. BAT 5 NORMAL feed, OFF. ASCENT ECA CONTROL, OPEN. You copy?

57:38:08
LMP
Standby 1.

LMP
Okay. In the CSM, on panel 5, we want CB LM POWER 1 and 2, OPEN. Then the LM POWER switch to reset, release. In the LM, panels 11 and 16, XLUNAR BUS TIE breakers closed. The DECSENT ECA CONTROL closed. On panel 14, BAT 5 NORMAL feed ON, followed by BATS 1, 2, 3, and 4 LOW VOLTAGE taps ON. Then BAT 5 NORMAL feed OFF. Then ASCENT ECA CONTROL breaker OPEN.

CAPCOM
That's a good readback, Fred.

57:39:15
CAPCOM
And 13, Houston. As a final effort here, we'd like you to turn on the fans in tank 2. Over.

CDR
Roger, understand. Turn on the fans in tank 2.

CDR
You want the O₂ fans in tank 2, Jack?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative, Jim.

CDR
O₂ tanks - fans in tank 2 are on.

CAPCOM
Roger.

57:41:32
CAPCOM
13, Houston. We'd like you to start making your way over to the LM now.

CMP
Fred and Jim are in the LM.

CAPCOM
Okay, Jack. Thank you.

57:42:50
CMP
Okay, you still with us, Houston?

57:43:03
CMP
Okay, Houston. You read, 13?

CAPCOM
Reading you loud and clear, Jack. I've got a procedure for -

CMP
Okay.

CAPCOM
- the guys in the LM.

CMP
You've got another one? Go ahead.

CAPCOM
I have an activation procedure. I'd like you to copy it down.

CMP
How long is it, Jack?

CAPCOM
It's just four lines. Go to Activation 1, do step 3. Go to Activation 11, omit step 1. Do Activation 12, and then go to Activation 13 and do step 1. Do you copy?

CDR
Okay. Is that Activation 1? Do step 3. Is that correct?

CAPCOM
Thats affirmative, Jim.

57:44:03
CDR
Activation 11, omit step 1, do the rest. Is that correct?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative.

CDR
Do Activation 12 and Activation 13, step 1.

CAPCOM
That's all correct.

CMP
Okay, Jack, pressure in tank 1 is approaching 100psi. What's going to be the symptoms of this fuel cell starting to drop off?

CAPCOM
Standby, Jack, we'll get the word on that.

CMP
Okay.

57:45:06
CAPCOM
And Jim, when you get to the end of that procedure, we'd also like to have you put the DEMAND REGs to CABIN.

CDR
DEMAND REGs to CABIN. Roger.

CDR
Jack, was that Activation 1 step 3 only, or all of Activation 1?

CAPCOM
That's - go all the way down to step 3, Jim.

CDR
Activation 1 to step 3. Roger.

57:46:48
CDR
Houston, Apollo 13. Never mind.

CAPCOM
13, say again, please.

CDR
Oh, we were curious about Activation 11 on the VHF.

57:47:05
CAPCOM
Omit the VHF.

57:48:17
CAPCOM
Jack, this is Houston. We want you to keep the IMU up and keep the lights on so you can see in there, and leave battery off - BATTERY A off. And at the appropriate time, we'll put it on MAIN A. And we're going to keep the IMU up so as we can get a coarse align in the LM.

CMP
Alright. Real good. Right now, we're charging BATTERY A. Do you want to discontinue that?

CAPCOM
Discontinue the charge on BATTERY A, Jack.

57:49:22
CMP
Okay, Jack. I discontinued charge on BATTERY A. You give me the call and I'll turn BUS TIE AC on.

CAPCOM
Roger. And we want you to keep the lights up and the IMU on.

CMP
Okay.

CAPCOM
And Jack, we'd like you to leave the COMM configuration as-is until we get COMM with the LM.

CMP
Okay.

57:51:08
CAPCOM
And 13, this is Houston. I've got another procedure for the LM. A short one.

CDR
Okay, ready to copy, Jack.

CAPCOM
Okay, on panel 11 we'd like you to close the LGC/DSKY circuit breaker. Then we want you to go to Activation 25, do steps 1, 2, and 3. Then go to Activation 30, and that will give us a docked IMU coarse align. Over.

CDR
Roger. Panel 11, close LGC circuit breaker. Activation 25, do steps 1, 2, 3, and then do complete Activation 30. Is that correct?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative. On panel 11, LGC/DSKY circuit breaker closed.

57:53:16
CAPCOM
And in the LM, let's go to panel 11 and close the SUIT FAN circuit breaker and get SUIT FAN 1 cranked up.

CDR
Okay. Panel 11, close SUIT FAN circuit breaker, and we'll get the suit fan cranked up.

CAPCOM
That's affirm.

CAPCOM
And Jack, in the CSM, go to BYPASS on the radiators and turn your GLYCOL PUMP off.

CMP
Okay.

57:54:01
CMP
Pull the BYPASS; GLYCOL PUMP going off.

CAPCOM
Roger.

57:55:43
CAPCOM
And 13, in the CSM we want to verify that all the FUEL CELL PUMPs are off, and we want to have you turn off the O₂ FANs in TANK 2.

CMP
Okay. Tank 2 fans going off.

57:56:00
CMP
Okay, that leaves me with TANK 1 FANs on, and TANK 1 HEATERs on.

CMP
FUEL CELL 2 PUMP going off now.

CAPCOM
And Jack, leave them both on in TANK 1.

CMP
Okay.

57:57:56
CAPCOM
13, Houston. We've got AOS on the LM here.

57:58:02
CMP
Okay.

57:59:23

How you going there? Activation 12, step 3.

58:00:18
LMP
Okay. And Jack, how do you read from Aquarius?

CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. Say again, please.

LMP
Okay, I was just making a COMM check here. I'm on high voltage taps.

CAPCOM
Roger. We see them, Fred, and I'm reading you loud and clear.

LMP
Okay. Didn't think I'd be back this soon.

LMP
Okay. What next, James?

LMP
Coarse align?

LMP
Do it right. Take your time.

58:01:32
CAPCOM
And Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to - on your alignment, can you continue right on through the fine align Activation 31? Go right on through step 7. Over.

LMP
Okay, you want to go on 31 through step number 7, Jack.

CAPCOM
That's affirmative. And Odyssey, we've got another configuration for you. All 16 RCS AUTO SELECT OFF. All RCS heaters off. Over.

58:02:06
CMP
Okay. I can verify all heaters off. Jack, I've got to keep a fairly minimum deadband until I get through this coarse align.

CAPCOM
Roger.

LMP
Okay, VERB 41, NOUN 20. Okay.

LMP
You want plus? Plus or minus? +302.43? Is that right?

58:03:12
LMP
Okay, let me enter it. Okay, what's the next one? +347.78. 347.78. Okay. 081.3. Is that right? ENTER. Okay.

CAPCOM
Odyssey, Houston, BATTERY A on.

CMP
BATTERY A on now.

58:04:00
CAPCOM
Go ahead, Aquarius.

CDR
Houston - okay, I want you to double check my arithmetic to make sure we got a good coarse align. The roll CAL angle was -2°. The Command Module angles were 355.57, 167.78, 351.87.

CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. We copy the roll CAL at -2.0. Command Module is 355.57, 167.78, 351.87.

58:05:23
LMP
VERB 41, we've done that. Okay.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. Request HIGH BIT RATE, please.

LMP
You want HIGH BIT RATE?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative, Fred. Won't cost us anything.

58:06:22
CAPCOM
Odyssey, Houston. We'd like you to, on your COMM configuration, go to PRIMARY POWER AMPL OFF, LOW BIT RATE, and DOWN VOICE BACKUP. Over.

CAPCOM
And Aquarius, we need your SUIT GAS DIVERTER to CABIN.

CMP
Alright. You got it.

58:07:02
CMP
Houston, I've gone to PRIMARY POWER AMPLIFIER OFF, LOW BIT RATE, DOWN VOICE BACKUP.

CAPCOM
Okay, Jack, thank you. And Aquarius, your arithmetic looks good on the coarse align there.

CDR
Okay. Okay, standby for an ENTER.

CDR
Three -

CMP
Get the GET; we need the GET. What is it? What's that? 58? 58:07?

58:08:14
CMP
58 what?

58:09:17
CDR
Houston, Aquarius.

CAPCOM
Go ahead, Aquarius.

CDR
Here are the gimbal angles. Command Module, 356.69, 163.42, 346.67. Aquarius is 302.26, 345.92, 011.79. Over.

CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. I got Command Module 356.65, 163.42, 346.67. Aquarius, 302.26, 345.92, 011.78.

58:10:07
CDR
That's 011.79.

CAPCOM
Say again, please.

CDR
The LM middle gimbal is 011.79.

CAPCOM
011.79. Got it.

58:12:19
CAPCOM
Odyssey, Houston. We need a COMMAND RESET on your - on your COMM, and then we'd like you to power down the CMC, power down the IMU, heaters off on the IMU, but leave your BATTERY A on.

CMP
Yeah.

CAPCOM
Odyssey, Houston.

58:13:08
LMP
Ask him if he's ready -

CDR
Houston, this is Odyssey. Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay, Jim.

CDR
Copy it down.

CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. I think I'm reading Jack, now. But what we want him to do is give us a COMMAND RESET. And then power down the CMC, power down the IMU, turn the IMU heater off, leave BATTERY A on. Over.

58:14:19
CMP
That's just about 80 - in fact, 82 hours out of the two primary cartridges. That's two guys. 44 is what LC8 got. That would be 88 hours. We got a secondary, you're right. We're listening.

CAPCOM
Odyssey, Houston.

CMP
They can turn it -

CMP
Go ahead?

CAPCOM
Yeah, Jack, did you copy down about the CMC and IMU?

CMP
Yeah, Jack; I read it back twice to you. COMMAND RESET, which I've done. I'm about to power down the IMU, power down the CMC, turn the IMU heaters off, leave BAT A on.

58:15:07
CAPCOM
That's affirm. Thank you.

CMP
Okay, I just got a MASTER ALARM and MAIN BUS A UNDERVOLT. And I'm starting to power down, now. We've lost the -

LMP
The only advantage to doing it early - if we can power back - the LM back down. The only advantage to doing it early is you can do a big burn now and a midcourse and then power the LM down. Otherwise, we've got to keep the LM powered up clear until we get around the Moon.

LMP
Plus, it would be inside on the burn.

LMP
I just hope the G&N hangs up on - hangs in on this one - I'd sure hate to do that one manual.

58:16:05
LMP
Oh boy.

CAPCOM
Odyssey, Houston. Couple circuit breakers for you. On panel 276, on your INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL, open CB number 3 and number 4.

CMP
Okay, Houston. Panel 276, INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL circuit breakers -

LMP
- you got a lot of light -

CMP
CB 3 and CB 4 are open.

CMP
What?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative, Odyssey. And also get your SCS electronics package and power off, and your FDAI POWER/GPI off, and your AUTO jet SELECT, all 16 off.

58:17:07
CMP
Okay, well wait a second. Let me - let me get the CMC powered down.

CAPCOM
Roger, Jack.

CDR
Jack, while he's doing that, copy down what you just said again. I want to write it down.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, we need to get your sublimator powered up. Activation page 20 and Activation page 21 step 3. Over.

CDR
Roger. Activation 20 and Activation page 21, step 3, sublimator.

CAPCOM
Roger.

58:18:00
LMP
That's Activation, page 20?

CMP
Okay, Jack. Now I have powered down my IMU. I have no control at all. I'm going to turn my 16 jets off. Say again the other things you wanted?

CAPCOM
Okay, Jack. We'd like you to turn off your O₂ TANK 2 heaters and fans. Correction - TANK 1. Turn the fans and heaters off.

CDR
Okay. And Jack, can we turn on the FDAI circuit breakers so we could have a ball to see if we go to gimbal lock or not?

CAPCOM
Standby.

CDR
Houston, he's going to give a 16 NOUN 20, Jack. And okay, I've got O₂ heaters and fans off in TANK 1.

58:19:15
CDR
And Jack, let me know if we get close to gimbal lock, would you?

CAPCOM
Jim, we didn't want you to power down the ball in the LM. We wanted you to power down the ball in the CSM.

CMP
Jack, they haven't powered down -

CDR
Jack, we don't have the balls powered up in the LM.

CMP
I have the CMC and IMU in the command module powered down. The heaters are out.

LMP
And the EVAP flow valve, that's open now. And I've undone my suit hoses here and opened up the suit flow valves. So we've got air flowing in the LM now.

58:20:11
CMP
Okay, Jack. Will you say again the SCS items you wanted me to power down?

CMP
Okay, Houston. Do you read Odyssey?

CDR
Hello, Houston. How do you read?

58:21:02
LMP
His gimbal lock and ours are different, Jim.

CAPCOM
Apollo 13, Houston. Say again, please. You were cut out.

CMP
Okay, Jack. Do you want me to proceed by the SCS powerdown checklist? I did not copy the SCS items you wanted me to power down.

CAPCOM
Okay, Odyssey. We want you to go SCS ELECTRONICS POWER OFF.

CMP
Okay. It's done.

CAPCOM
FDAI POWER/GPI OFF. AUTO jet SELECT, 16 -

CMP
That's done.

CAPCOM
OFF. And all your ROTATIONAL CONTROL POWER, OFF.

CMP
It's done. ROTATION CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, and AUTO closed OFF.

CDR
Okay, Jack. Tell me there - we need to know when we're getting close to gimbal lock in the LM. We have no balls right now.

58:22:06
CAPCOM
Okay. We want you to power up your eight-ball. We want you to get your RCS heaters on. Pressurize the RCS and open up the MAIN SOVs. Over.

LMP
Okay Jack, I've got two commander FDAI breakers in, AC and DC, and the two GASTA breakers in AC and DC. And next you'll want the RCS heaters all on with the - pressurize the RCS and then the MAIN SOVs open. And I think they're already open.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CAPCOM
And Freddo, get the TCA breakers in last, please.

58:23:00
LMP
Alright, Jim. I'm holding off on those until you give me further word anyway. I'm just going to pressurize right now.

CDR
Jack, are you reading LM gimbal angles?

58:24:16
CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. I have some gyro torquing angles and the Odyssey is powered down, attitude-control-wise, so LM's got attitude control now.

58:25:13
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston.

LMP
Go ahead, Jack.

CAPCOM
Okay. We want you to know that we've got some gyro torquing angles for you. And we want you to tell us when you've got attitude control in the LM.

LMP
Okay. We're still working on the pressurization. I'm getting Jim on the horn here so he can help out there.

CAPCOM
Roger.

58:26:10
CMP
Wonder why.

LMP
We got to get this pressurized.

CDR
Houston, Aquarius.

CAPCOM
Standby 1, Aquarius. Odyssey, we'd like you to go DIRECT RCS and hold your present attitude out the window until the LM gets RCS powered up. Go ahead, Jim.

58:27:12
CDR
Well, that's my question. We're not - our 16 20 doesn't match our eight-ball here. We went FDAIs ON, but we don't have our balls completely powered up. There may be a bellyband to get our - the angles don't look the same and we don't want to go into gimbal lock.

CAPCOM
Roger. How far are you from RCS power up - RCS pressurization?

LMP
Okay, Jack. I'm right up to where it's MASTER ARM ON; RCS FIRE; both LOGIC POWERs out, that isn't closing the normal circuit breakers. You didn't have me do that. Do you want A in and then I'll fire them?

58:28:00
CAPCOM
Okay 13, you're both talking at once. One at a time, please.

CMP
Okay, who's first?

CAPCOM
Close LOGIC POWER A and B, Fred, and pressurize RCS.

LMP
Okay.

CAPCOM
Go ahead, Odyssey.

CMP
Okay, I'm going to try to do the best I can. I've got one attitude reference: I'm going to fly according to the lunar terminator.

CAPCOM
Roger, Jack. Just maintain attitude.

58:29:05
CMP
What am I doing? I can't do that anyway. Let's see - crossfeed. Nose up. Down. And - -

CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. We'll have to get some AC up so you can get a ball reading. Close your BUS TIE INVERTER circuit breakers, all four of them on panel 11. Close your AC BUS VOLT circuit breaker on panel 11. On panel 16, INVERTER 2, CLOSE. Select INVERTER 2. Over.

CDR
That's been completed, Jack.

LMP
Okay, the RCS is pressurized now.

58:30:40
LMP
Okay, Jack. Do you want us to proceed right on down the line with the RCS checkout and Activation 37 now?

CAPCOM
Standby, Fred.

58:31:03
LMP
Hell, is he still firing up there?

CAPCOM
Okay, Fred. Negative on the Activation on page 37. We want your RCS pressurized and then get your TCA breakers in and go to PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD.

CDR
Okay, Jack, how do you read?

CAPCOM
Okay, this is Houston. We want you to load the DAP with 30120.

58:32:07
CDR
Load the DAP with 30120.

CDR
Complete.

LMP
Okay, we need to change that CSM weight.

CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. Your CSM weight is 63400.

CDR
And Jack's alive to take control of the LM to stay away from gimbal lock. Over.

CAPCOM
Affirmative. Take control of the LM. PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD.

Okay, let's see if we can fire these things, or if we have - ATT HOLD?

CDR
Are you firing anything?

CMP
I don't think so.

CDR
Okay, I've got DIRECT.

58:34:05
CAPCOM
And Aquarius, check your ATCA (PGNS) breaker on panel 11 IN.

CDR
Say again?

CAPCOM
Close, on panel 11, circuit breaker ATCA (PGNS).

Okay, we've got ATCA (PGNS) closed.

CDR
Okay, shut it down!

LMP
Okay, Jack. We got it.

58:35:22
CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. How's the attitude control?

CDR
Okay, Jack. We've got attitude control now in the LM. We're going to try to rotate up through the bellyband.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CAPCOM

Can I get a towel?

58:48:02
CAPCOM
Roger. As soon as you get a chance to - or in a position to - take a look, we'd like to know if you can see stars for alignment purposes.

LMP
Okay. Jim's going to be in trouble in our present attitude out his side.

CDR
The Sun's there.

CDR
Wait 1.

LMP
What have you got? How much you got left in battery A? Okay. I wish I knew what the hell they were thinking. Right now -

CDR
They're talking about powering down and doing a P51 here?

LMP
No, they were just thinking about P52 and going through the -

58:49:01
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston, negative on the P51. We want to stay just like we are, but we'd like to be able to correlate what you're doing with some simulator work we're going to crank up. And so if you can give us information as to what stars you can see out the window, we can make that correlation.

CDR
Would you say that one more time? Give me the top tier - the top tier.

CAPCOM
Jim, what we want you to do is go with your current fine align and disregard the P51. What we're attempting to do is to crank up some LMS simulations to correlate what we can get out your window with what we can get out the LMS window to see if that will help us any. So when you can see some stars, if you can - you think you can recognize them and recognize constellations, please let us know.

58:50:03
CDR
Okay, we'll check. Standby.

CDR
Okay, watch the -

58:52:13
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. We notice that the O₂ pressure in ASCENT TANK O₂ is a little high, so we want to use some of it. So close DESCENT O₂ and open ASCENT O₂ TANK 2. Over.

LMP
Okay, Jack. Switched, now I'm on ASCENT number 2 O₂ tank. DESCENT O₂ is closed.

CAPCOM
Roger, Fred.

58:54:01
CDR
Okay. Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?

CAPCOM
Reading you five square, Jim. Go ahead.

CDR
Okay. I'm looking out of Fred's window. I see a lot of particles out there, but a lot of that stuff is still drifting away from us; so a lot of it is flashing in the local vicinity, and I don't recognize any constellations right now in this particular attitude.

CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. If that status changes, please let us know.

CDR
Roger. We're continuing to drift.

CDR
Okay, use your TTCAs to roll.

58:55:09
CAPCOM
And Aquarius, Houston, I've got some circuit breakers you can open to power down displays. In addition, I have a P30 maneuver PAD. Over.

CDR
Roger. Standby. Get the CS - get the PAD book.

LMP
Get the LM data - get the LM - book.

CDR
And, say - we're getting the PAD book now, Jack - and say the first power down?

CAPCOM
Okay, I have some circuit breakers that you can open up in order to power down displays.

LMP
Okay. Standby 1, Jack. I'm going to get my COMM carrier on.

CDR
No, no, no, Get the - get the Command Module PAD book - alright, tell you what, get all the LM stuff. Give me the LM stuff right now. Jack, give me the LM stuff.

58:57:08
CDR
Alright, Jack.

CDR
Hey, what do you need out of here?

CMP
Can you give us the ?? data?

CDR
Here.

58:58:22
CDR
Looks like I'm cross-coupling here. I might as well -

LMP
Yes, you are.

CDR
Well, I want to get out of this roll.

CDR
What if I go to -

58:59:52
CDR
Hello Houston, Aquarius.

CMP
Back on? Yes.

59:00:04
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. You're -

LMP
Houston, Aquarius.

CAPCOM
- watching your middle gimbal there, aren't you? Go ahead, Aquarius.

LMP
Okay. Go ahead with the breakers first, Jack.

CAPCOM
Okay. You watching your middle gimbal there?

CDR
Tell them we are.

CMP
Your attitude is just straight pitch down, Jim.

CMP
Okay, you're moving away.

CAPCOM
Okay, Fred. I've got 6 circuit breakers for you.

LMP
Okay. Go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay, they're all on panel 11. Row 1, under AC BUS B, open HELIUM PQGS for PROPELLANT DISPLAY.

59:01:07
CDR
It's OPEN.

CAPCOM
On row 2. FLIGHT DISPLAYS, open THRUST, open MISSION TIMER, open RNG/RNG RT/ALT/ALT RT, and open the AC BUS A RNG/RNG RT/ALT/ALT RT.

CDR
They're OPEN.

LMP
Okay, they're all OPEN.

CAPCOM
Okay. On row 4, PGNS, SIGNAL STRENGTH DISPLAY.

LMP
It's OPEN.

CAPCOM
Okay, that concludes the power down of displays. And I have a P30 PAD for you.

LMP
Okay, go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay, the purpose is a pericynthion plus 2 hours DPS abort. NOUN 33: 079:25:26.48. +1633.0, -0014.5, -0751.5. Apogee not applicable, perigee is +0020.5, 1797.7, 8:35. 268, 264. +1641.0, -0014.5, -0733.8. COAS is N/A.

59:03:19
CAPCOM
And I have two gimbal trim angles for you which will be updated. Right now, however, we want you to go with pitch 5.86, roll 6.75. Over.

LMP
What was that for?

CDR
Pitch and yaw, maybe, huh?

LMP
Okay. What was the last two this you gave me, a pitch and roll angle for what?

CAPCOM
That's for your DPS trim.

CDR
Those were gimbal angles for - pitch and yaw.

LMP
Ah, Roger. GDAs.

CAPCOM
Yeah, that's what I mean. Sorry.

LMP
Pericynthion plus 2. Okay, DPS pericynthion plus 2, at 079:25:026.48. +1633.0, -0114.5, -0751.5. HA N/A, HP +0020.5, 1797.7. 8:35. 268, 264. +1641.0, -0014.5, -0733.8 -

59:04:42
CDR
Did we lose water in the -

LMP
N/A on the COAS, and you gave me GDA angles of: pitch 5.86, and you want roll 6.75.

CAPCOM
Good readback, Fred.

59:05:00
CDR
Yes, lose - get all the little bags you can with water.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. Say again, please.

LMP
Okay, we didn't answer back there, Jack.

LMP
Check to see if you're on VOX.

CDR
No.

LMP
Neither am I. Okay.

LMP
Why the hell are we maneuvering at all now? Are we still venting?

CDR
Well, we're ATT HOLD for one thing - I mean, we're at MIN IMPULSE.

LMP
No, I mean why can't you null them out somewhere?

CDR
Every time I try to - I can't take that doggone roll out. I got to wait until we get around to the bellyband.

LMP
Wait a minute. Do you - you fight roll by using the TTCA left/right. That's what you need to play with.

59:06:05
CDR
Okay, we'll try that. Let me get around though. Let's roll. Let it roll all the way.

LMP
Yeah, you can't let it roll all the way!

CDR
I know. I know. But I mean -

LMP
Okay, until it's upside down at least, huh?

CDR
Yup.

LMP
Okay.

LMP
Well, should I ask him what the return time on that one is? Or are you interested?

CDR
Let's get the first things first.

LMP
Oh, you don't want to hear. Let me figure some times out, here. That's at 79, and what are we at now? About - do we - do we - we don't even have computer time, do we? Nope.

59:07:00
LMP
Hey, Jack? Do you still have a mission timer? You don't? Okay.

CDR
Okay, let's ask - let's ask Houston to give us a mission timer - computer time. They can uplink it to us. Yeah, hold it.

LMP
Go ahead.

CDR
Houston, Aquarius.

CAPCOM
Go ahead, Aquarius.

CDR
You know, we don't have a - I don't think we have a computer clock going, and why don't you uplink that stuff to us?

CAPCOM
Roger.

CAPCOM
And Freddo, I got some fast circuit breakers on panel 16 for you.

LMP
Okay, go ahead.

CAPCOM
Okay. On row 1 under FLIGHT DISPLAYS, SYSTEM ENGINEER X-POINTER, OPEN. Under RCS B -

59:08:00
LMP
It's OPEN.

CAPCOM
Open the TEMP/PRESS DISPLAY FLAGS and PQGS/DISPLAYS.

LMP
Okay. They're both OPEN.

CAPCOM
Okay, Fred. On row 3 under COMM, open DISPLAYS and under ECS, open DISPLAYS.

LMP
Okay. COMM DISPLAYS, ECS DISPLAYS - both OPEN.

CAPCOM
Okay, and two more. In row 4 under HEATERS, open DISPLAYS and under EPS, open DISPLAYS.

LMP
Okay. HEADERS DISPLAY, EPS DISPLAY OPEN. And I've long since had all the lights off; floods, etc.

CDR
Where are those bags? Where are those bags for weighing water in the PLSS?

59:09:02
LMP
Why?

CDR
We're going to fill up command module water.

LMP
Hell, do you need a QD -

LMP
- Jim. No way to get ours in there, I don't think.

LMP
Hey, Jim -

CDR
I wonder if one of our water - jet is - okay, let's control -

CDR
What else can we fill up there?

59:10:01
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. We're not going to be able to uplink your time because of the IU, and we have a frequency problem there. But what I'd like to do is give you a time to set up on your mission timer and give you a mark and then you can put it into the DSKY from there. Over.

CDR
Okay, standby.

LMP
Wait a minute. Why do we need a mission timer right now, anyway? I mean, that bad - they'd tell us.

CDR
Well, I'd rather have a timer going so that we - then we can put it in the DSKY. Then we shut down the mission timer.

LMP
Oh, is that what you want to do?

CDR
Yeah. Hey. OMNI.

CDR
Switch them. Okay, let's fire up the mission timer.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston, we need FORWARD OMNI.

59:11:06
CDR
FORWARD OMNI.

LMP
Say again, Jack.

CDR
FORWARD OMNI.

LMP
I am.

LMP
Okay, Houston. If that call was an OMNI switch, I'm in FORWARD now.

CDR
Okay, Freddo. how do I get the mission timer up? Gotta get the mission timer cranked in.

LMP
You got it on?

CDR
I got the mission timer circuit breaker in.

LMP
Okay, we're going to probably need NUMERICS LIGHTING. There you go, you got it.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. I think we've got a better way of getting your mission time up.

CDR
Go ahead with it.

59:12:00
CAPCOM
Okay, we can do a VERB 55, ENTER. And then put in R1 -00088. In R2 -00059. R3 -03274.

LMP
Watch the crappin' attitude.

CDR
We're okay.

LMP
God damn; I wish you'd get to something I know.

CDR
Well, as soon as you get over here, we'll stop it with the TTCA.

LMP
Okay.

CAPCOM
And Aquarius, Houston. We've got you both on VOX.

LMP
They've got what?

CDR
You want us on VOX, Jack?

CAPCOM
We have you on VOX. We're reading you loud and clear and the clock took good.

59:13:18
LMP
Okay. Looks like we're on the FDA route there, Jack.

LMP
Okay, Jack. How do you read me on NORMAL VOICE now?

CAPCOM
Hearing you 5 square, Fred.

LMP
Okay.

59:14:12
CAPCOM
And Aquarius, we're ready for a VERB 74 when you can give it to us.

LMP
You got it.

CAPCOM
Okay. And one other thing we noticed: when you pressurized the RCS, we got an increase in pressure in the ascent tanks, and so we want to have you verify that the ascent feeds are closed. In order to do that, on panel 11, close the ASCENT FEED 1 and 2 circuit breakers - and cycle the Parker valves, and then open the ASCENT FEED circuit breakers on panel 11.

59:15:08
CDR
Completed, Houston.

CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. Thank you.

59:17:53
LMP
And Jack, Aquarius. What kind of return time does this maneuver give us?

59:18:02
CAPCOM
That puts you back in the water at 133 hours.

LMP
133, eh?

CAPCOM
Affirm.

CAPCOM
And that's an Atlantic landing site.

LMP
Atlantic landing?

CAPCOM
Affirmative. That's the PAD we've given you, but we may change our minds later on. We want you to have this info for now. And that's the minimum -

LMP
Okay.

CAPCOM
- minimum time return.

59:20:09
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. We've got to change the REFSMMAT to the one to which you're aligned. So we'd like to have P00 and DATA and we'll ship that up to you.

CDR
Roger.

LMP
Okay, you got it, Jack.

CAPCOM
Roger. Coming up.

59:21:22
CAPCOM
Aquarius, could you give us DATA, please?

CDR
Okay, Jack, you got it.

LMP
He's got the updata link - the DUA breaker may not be in, Jack.

CAPCOM
Okay, Fred, and close the DUA breaker.

CDR
It's in now, Jack.

CAPCOM
Okay, Jim, and it's coming up now. Thank you.

59:28:04
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. We're finished with the uplink. The computer's yours. We'd like to power down the DUA, so pull the DUA circuit breaker please.

LMP
Okay. Updata link breaker's coming OPEN.

59:36:25
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to have AFT OMNI, and we're going to lose contact with you for about a minute here while we try to establish tracking. And our latest data shows that your closest approach to the Moon is going to be 60 miles perigee, over.

LMP
Okay. Closest approach, 60 miles, and I'm sitting on AFT OMNI now.

CAPCOM
Roger, we'll probably be going off the air here for about a minute.

59:39:18
(note)
<< A phone conversation is caught here between CAPCOM and Warren North, Chief of Flight Crew Support, coördinating work with the astronauts and engineers working in the simulators on the ground to support the crew. >>

59:41:12
CDR
Houston, Aquarius. Over.

CAPCOM
Go ahead, Aquarius.

CDR
Okay, we're thinking of rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch.

CDR
We're thinking about rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch to save urine heater power. What do you think?

CAPCOM
Standby 1.

CDR
Or better still so we can - won't freeze up our urine dump.

CAPCOM
Roger, that sounds like a good plan, Jim. Why don't you go ahead with that one?

59:42:59
CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. Down here we're getting regrouped, trying to work on your control modes and trying to set up something for PTC and taking a look at consumables as opposed to flight plan, and so forth. And as soon as we get all that information, we'll pass it up to you. We also have the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking at docked burns and also trying to see what kind of alignment procedures they can come up with for looking at stars out the window. So if you ever are able to see any stars out there and think you can do an alignment out the window, why let us know.

59:43:40
CDR
Okay, Jack. Right now we're not able to. The sunlight's reflecting off the thrusters and whatever debris came away at the time of the mishap is still with us, such that the stars are hard to find. And why - what respect do you want us to do the stars out the window - just to check the LMS run, is that correct?

59:44:04
CAPCOM
That's affirm. We'd like to correlate what information we get with yours, so that if we can use it to update the platform, we can.

CAPCOM
What we're really trying to do, Jim, is see if we can do a COAS align so we can power down the platform.

59:45:25
CDR
Houston, Aquarius. We're getting an awful lot of static on the uplink now, and we're not reading you at all.

CDR
I have good signal strength and I'm on AFT OMNI.

CAPCOM
How do you read now, Aquarius?

59:47:06
Guest CAPCOM
Hey, Jim, do you suppose that you could orient the LM so that the Service Module would be between you and the Sun? I believe you could see - recognize constellations out your front windows then.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. Radio check.

59:48:14
CDR
Okay, Jack. How do you read now?

CAPCOM
Okay, hearing you 5 square now, Jim. And the question we have is: is there some way you can orient the spacecraft so that the Service Module is between the LM and the Sun so you can recognize constellations out the window? And secondly, can you see anything out the AOT?

59:49:28
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

59:53:46
CAPCOM
Aquarius, how are you reading me now?

59:56:56
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

59:57:08
CAPCOM
Aquarius, request FORWARD OMNI, please.

59:58:22
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. Request FORWARD OMNI. How do you read?

59:59:06
LMP
Okay, Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?

CAPCOM
Hello there, Aquarius. Loud and clear. How do you read me?

CDR
There's an awful lot of background -

LMP
Okay, we've got a lot of background static, Jack. You're down in the mud. You having a ground problem?

CAPCOM
What we tried to do was to get the IU frequency shifted off a little bit so that we'd have less interference. I think it'll come up - what we want you to do is turn on your descent oxygen and turn off your ascent oxygen. Over.

CAPCOM
And request FORWARD OMNI.

LMP
You're unreadable, Jack. We've got our signal strength meter - right now it keeps wavering up and down. The best I'm getting is about 2.4 AGC.

CAPCOM
Roger. Request FORWARD OMNI.

LMP
I am on FORWARD OMNI. I've been on FORWARD OMNI.

60:00:44
LMP
Okay, how do you read, Jack?

CAPCOM
I'm hearing you 5 square, Fred. How me?

60:01:13
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

60:02:03
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. Radio check.

LMP
Okay, every time you transmit, Jack, the AGC starts to drop off and the static level cranks up.

CAPCOM
Okay, Fred. You're loud and clear.

LMP
I wish you were.

CAPCOM
Fred, go to DESCENT O₂.

LMP
DESCENT O₂. Roger.

60:04:05
CDR
Hello Houston, Aquarius.

CAPCOM
Hello there, Aquarius. How do you read me now?

CDR
Hello Houston, Aquarius.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. Go.

CDR
Okay. That's the first clear word we've heard from you, Jack. Do you think it could be my pitch attitude that's breaking up your incoming? I guess you've been hearing us.

CAPCOM
We have been hearing you, and the problem is on the ground. I hope we have it corrected now.

CDR
Okay. That sounds good.

CAPCOM
We're considering powering down the PGNS but we want to know what capability you have to do a coarse and fine align. And we read your conversation about being unable to see out the window very good. How about out the AOT?

60:05:26
LMP
He's looking now.

CAPCOM
Okay, and the other thing we thought you might try is to put the Service Module between you and the Sun, and then to see if you can see anything out the window in that attitude.

Guest CAPCOM
The reason that we think that that would work is that it worked on Apollo 10. It made the constellations all recognizable when we put the Service Module - in our case the LM, between us and the Sun.

60:06:00
CAPCOM
AFT OMNI, Fred.

LMP
You're down in the mud again, Jack. And it appears that some other circuit is feeding through on there with you.

CAPCOM
Roger. AFT OMNI.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, AFT OMNI.

60:07:29
LMP
Okay, you're down in the mud again, Jack. Lots of background static.

60:08:10
CAPCOM
AFT OMNI, Aquarius.

60:09:00
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston.

60:11:18
LMP
Okay. Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?

60:18:21
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

60:22:46
LMP
Hello Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?

CAPCOM
Hello there, Aquarius. Loud and clear. How me, now?

CDR
Okay, we're reading you loud and clear, Jack. I hope it stays this time.

CAPCOM
Okay. We'd like to brief you on what our plan is. We're, at this time, water critical in the LM. So we'd like to use as little as possible. To do this, we're going to plan to make a free-return maneuver of 16 feet per second at 61 hours, which is 37 minutes from now. Then we're going to power down the PGNS, and then we'll - at 79 hours, we'll go ahead and make another abort maneuver to kick what we've got. But we'd like to get that PGNS powered down as soon as possible.

60:23:39
CAPCOM
That would be after the midcourse and - so, how do you feel about making a 16 foot-per-second burn in 37 minutes?

CDR
Well we'll give it a try, Jack, if that's all we've got. That's a 16 foot-per-second DPS burn in 37 minutes?

CAPCOM
Roger. We're working up a PAD for it, but we want to know what you think about doing it at that time.

60:24:08
CDR
Well, we'll do it. Could you give us a little bit more time?

CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. We'd like to get a suggested time from you. We can figure out a free-return maneuver for any time you want to give us, so if you'll give us the time you'd like to shoot for, we'll figure out a PAD.

CDR
Okay, that sounds good. I think if we have a little bit more time - we want to do it right. Standby 1.

60:25:04
CDR
Let's shoot for an hour if we can, Jack. How's that?

CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. How about 61 hours and 30 minutes? That's an hour and 5 from now.

CDR
Okay. We'll do it and we want to be sure we talk back and forth, now, to make sure we get this burn off right.

CAPCOM
Affirm.

LMP
Okay. In the interim, Jack, I looked around again and I saw that we have a radar and a landing radar heater breaker in. Can I pull those out?

CAPCOM
Affirmative. Pull them both out.

CAPCOM
And now we want to ask you a question about alignments and so forth: we wanted to know if you can see any stars out of the AOT. We also wanted to know if you could use the Service Module to cast a shadow on the LM windows and then look out the windows to see stars for a P51 COAS alignment.

60:26:14
CDR
Okay, in this attitude, Jack, that we're pitching around, I cannot use the AOT to see stars. We - we're just not able to see them at all. Now, we may be able to maneuver off in yaw or - and/or roll, and see stars. Right now, we haven't been able to. The AOT is useless. The Command Module structure is just radiating too much light into the - into the telescope.

CAPCOM
Okay. And how about using the Service Module to cast a shadow on the Commander's window? If you do that, can you see stars for a COAS alignment?

CDR
We could give that a try, Jack, although I don't know how successful it will be. We tried to do it; the light shines off our quads which makes it difficult to see stars. We do have the Earth and Moon, if that can be of assistance.

60:27:18
LMP
Another problem: right now, Jack, I'm looking out the right window and it's pretty dark out that window but there are about a thousand or so false stars out here from - left over from some of the debris. It's hard to discern what's real and not real.

CAPCOM
Okay. That's good information. And during the time that we see you're continuing to pitch, if you ever get in a position where you think the AOT might be of some use, we'd like you to periodically look out of it and see if you can see some stars that would enable us to get a P52.

CDR
Okay, will do. And also, let me ask you a question: in this configuration, docked, we have to use the TTCA to control pitch and roll. And just how much can we use that without really changing our trajectory? We only have 60 miles to play with.

60:28:22
CAPCOM
Roger. We'll put that to them.

LMP
Okay, Jack. Are you ready to go to work with me on the 2-hour DPS activation and contingency book, page 1?

CAPCOM
Roger. We're ready to go.

60:29:05
LMP
Okay, item 1 we can - 1 through 5 we can scratch off as done. Is that correct?

CAPCOM
Standby 1, Fred.

60:30:19
CAPCOM
Okay, Fred. Let's go ahead. Step 1, page 1. Everybody's listening.

LMP
Okay. I've looked around, and I've essentially done steps 1 through 5 with the exception of floodlights and utility lights, and I think we'll just do without those.

CAPCOM
Roger. Your choice.

LMP
Okay. On EPS activation, we're through step - we're through that - bottom of that page. That's all done.

CAPCOM
We concur. Page 2.

60:31:13
LMP
Okay, in essence, we've circumvented step 4, and we're not sitting with all 4 acs - descent BATs on high voltage taps, so I'll scratch off step 4.

CAPCOM
Roger, and in step 5 we want to leave INVERTER 1 circuit breaker OPEN.

LMP
Roger. In step 5, we'll leave INVERTER 1 CB OPEN.

CAPCOM
Omit step 6.

LMP
Okay. For the time being, our mission timer is the computer. So mission timer activation - scratch off.

60:32:05
CAPCOM
Roger.

LMP
Okay. We've done the primary glycol loop activation.

CAPCOM
We verify it.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, we recommend you leave the caution and warning off on page 3.

LMP
Okay, I was going to say that next. Page 3 we'll just scratch item 1. And item 2, I've already got the RCS heaters on. And I don't know if I gave you the time or you got the time on the PRIMARY EVAP FLOW number 1 OPEN.

60:33:03
CAPCOM
We got the time.

LMP
Okay. Let's go to the CB pages now.

CAPCOM
Freddo, did you close the ENGINE CONTROL breaker on panel 11?

LMP
What control was that, Jack?

CAPCOM
Did you close the S/C ENGINE CONTROL breaker on panel 11? As we got step 1 there on page 3.

LMP
Okay, the -

LMP
Okay, yes. The EPS DESCENT ECA CONTROL breaker is CLOSED on 11.

60:34:01
CAPCOM
Roger, and how about the - on panel 11, S/C ENGINE CONTROL, CLOSED?

CAPCOM
AFT OMNI, Fred.

LMP
Okay.

LMP
We're AFT OMNI, and we have the S/C ENGINE CONTROL breaker CLOSED.

CAPCOM
Roger. Let's go on with the circuit breaker panel checkout.

LMP
Okay. I'll just give you - I think it'll be easier, here, to give you what I got in.

LMP
Okay, in the top row on 11, we have the four AC BUS TIE breakers IN and the AC BUS VOLTS breaker IN, and that's it.

LMP
Second row, we have the four TCA breakers IN. We have the GASTA under FLIGHT DISPLAYS and COMMANDER's FDAI. And likewise under AC BUS A, we have a GASTA and a COMMANDER FDAI breaker IN. That's it.

60:35:17
LMP
On row 3, we have a SIGNAL CONDITIONER 1. We have the ATCA (PGNS). We have the ENGINE CONTROL breaker, ATTITUDE DIRECT CONTROL breaker, and the - under LIGHTING, ANUN/DOCK/COMPONENT breaker IN. And one other: ED LOGIC POWER A - ED LOGIC POWER A is also IN.

CAPCOM
Copy.

LMP
Okay, under the fourth - fourth row, we got all the QUAD HEATER breakers IN. SUIT FAN 1. Under ECS, GLYCOL 1 and 2.

60:36:02
LMP
And under COMM we have COMMANDER AUDIO IN. And PGNS LGC/DSKY, IMU STANDBY, IMU OPERATE, and that's it.

LMP
Okay. In the bottom row: EPS, we have the BAT FEED TIE both IN, and we have the CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS IN, the X-LUNAR BUS TIE, DESCENT ECA CONTROL, DESCENT ECA, and the DC BUS VOLTs breaker.

CAPCOM
Roger, we copy.

LMP
That completes it for panel 11.

CAPCOM
Okay, standby.

LMP
Okay.

LMP
As I see it, some of the checklist are - we need the DECA GIMBAL IN sooner or later -

60:37:00
CAPCOM
That's affirm. Close the DECA GIMBAL.

LMP
- and probably - okay, DECA GIMBAL - and sooner or later, we're going to need DECA POWER, I guess also.

CAPCOM
Alright, DECA POWER will come up later in the procedure, Freddo.

LMP
Okay.

60:38:42
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. On your circuit breaker checklist, on panel 11 and 16, we want you to configure the panels as outlined in the checklist.

LMP
Okay. You want us to configure as per checklist. Okay, we'll do that.

60:39:03
CAPCOM
That's right. Close the black ones and open the white ones.

LMP
Yeah, I think we can manage that.

CDR
With the Activation power-up, we're starting right now.

60:40:12
CDR
Houston, we might as well leave our RCS TCAs IN, right?

CAPCOM
Affirmative, Jim. Leave your RCS TCAs in on panel 11.

LMP
Yeah, I just used my Pentel pen and made those white ones black ones.

CAPCOM
Roger. Same on 16, Fred.

LMP
Roger.

CDR
And you might look there, Houston, to see what circuit breakers aren't required, like the tape recorder.

CAPCOM
We're looking.

60:41:41
CAPCOM
Okay, Jim. On panel 11 over there, you can also leave open the RENDEZVOUS RADAR HEATER breaker and the LANDING RADAR HEATER breaker, in addition to the tape recorder.

CDR
They're out.

60:42:05
CDR
I'm leaving a few in, Jack, too, like the SUIT FAN 1 is still IN, RCS SYSTEM is still IN, the TCAs.

CDR
ATTITUDE DIRECT CONTROL is IN.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CDR
How about if I leave the VHF A and B OFF?

LMP
I switched to FORWARD OMNI.

CAPCOM
Okay, we can leave the VHF powered down too.

60:43:01
CDR
And do you want the SECONDARY S-BAND?

CAPCOM
Negative on SECONDARY S-BAND. Leave them open.

CDR
UP DATA LINK is IN. Do you want that in or out?

CAPCOM
Leave the UP DATA LINK OPEN. We'll call for it when you want to put it in.

60:44:37
LMP
Okay, Jack. On panel 11 on the top row, do you really want the PROPULSION PQGS and ASCENT HELIUM REGs IN?

LMP
And also the SYSTEM ENGINEER X-POINTER breaker.

CAPCOM
Roger. Negative on the PQGS. Negative on the ASCENT HELIUM REG. And negative on the X-POINTER.

60:45:17
LMP
Okay. On the second row, I'm going to leave the FLOODLIGHT breaker open.

CAPCOM
Concur.

LMP
And we're again up to - do you want the CWEA enabled?

CAPCOM
Negative on the CWEA.

LMP
Okay.

60:46:02
LMP
Okay, since we're - are we going to power up the AGS or should I concern myself with the ATCA breaker?

CAPCOM
Negative on the AGS.

CAPCOM
However, Fred, we need the ATCA breaker IN.

LMP
Okay, ATCA breaker's IN.

LMP
Yeah - I guess for the backup power supply.

LMP
Okay, how about ATCA AGS?

CAPCOM
Negative on ATCA AGS.

60:47:06
LMP
And I'm leaving the SUIT FLOW CONTROL breaker OPEN.

CAPCOM
Let's close the SUIT FLOW CONTROL, Freddo -

CDR
And Jack, OMNIs going now -

CAPCOM
- it doesn't take any current.

LMP
Okay. Without suits it doesn't do us much good either, though.

LMP
Okay, and are we going to continue to be able to operate off the OMNIs, Jack? So can I leave the S-BAND antenna powered down?

60:48:18
CAPCOM
Okay, Freddo, we don't plan to use the steerable antenna, although we want to leave the heaters on. So it looks like you ought to open up COMM S-BAND ANTENNA, but leave S-BAND ANTENNA HEATERS closed.

LMP
Roger. COMM S-BAND is OPEN, S-BAND HEATER breaker is still CLOSED.

60:49:27
LMP
And on the bottom row, Jack, I'm going to leave the HEATER DISPLAY breaker out, which we had pulled before, and EPS DISPLAY. But I question: do we want the ASCENT ECA breaker in, as prescribed?

CAPCOM
Standby.

CAPCOM
That's a negative on the ASCENT ECA breaker, leave it OPEN.

60:50:02
CAPCOM
And Aquarius, we need P00 and DATA -

LMP
And Jack -

CAPCOM
- and we'll give you a state vector and target load.

LMP
Okay. We need the UP LINK breaker in, then, now.

CAPCOM
That's affirmative.

CDR
Okay. And Jack, will you give us that - how about the ORDEAL breaker? Can I pull that? We don't need that, do we?

CAPCOM
Negative on the ORDEAL. Leave it OPEN.

LMP
And how about the ASCENT ECA breaker on panel 11? Jim has it in over there.

60:51:02
CAPCOM
And on panel 11, ASCENT ECA can be OPEN.

CDR
It's OPEN.

CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. We're GO on the circuit breaker configuration as you have it now.

LMP
Roger.

60:52:04
CAPCOM
And Aquarius, tests in the simulator just showed that if you want to let the PGNS DAP hold your attitude for you, it will.

CDR
Okay, very well.

CDR
And Jack, because it will take quite a while to get back to the attitude, I think we ought to think about going there very shortly.

CAPCOM
Roger. I have a PAD for you.

CAPCOM
I have a P30 maneuver PAD.

CDR
Roger - standby.

LMP
Ready for it, Jack.

CAPCOM
Okay, they want you to hold your maneuver until we finish making the LOAD. We haven't completed it yet. Are you ready to copy P30 maneuver PAD?

60:53:08
CDR
That's affirm.

CAPCOM
Okay, here we go. The purpose is midcourse correction for free-return. NOUN 33: 061:29:42.84. -0021.3, +0004.1, -0031.2. HA and HP are N/A, ∆V 0038.0. 0:31. 120, 298. -0021.3, +0004.1, -0031.2. COAS N/A. And I have your LM GDA angles: pitch 5.86, roll 6.75. Your DPS throttling: 5 seconds at 10%, burn the rest at 40%. Your ullage will be 2 jets for 10 seconds.

60:54:57
LMP
Okay, Jack. We have a P30 maneuver PAD, a midcourse for free-return. NOUN 33: 061:29:42.84. -0021.3, +004.1, -0031.2. HA and HP N/A, ∆VR 0038.0. 0:31. 120, 298. -0021.3, +0004.1, -0031.2. COAS N/A. GDA angles, pitch 5.86, roll 6.75. DPS throttle 5 seconds at 10%, burn the rest at 40%. And we need a 2-jet, 10 second ullage.

60:56:02
CAPCOM
That's a good readback, Fred. I'd like to verify, however, in NOUN 81 in VY, it's plus three balls 41.

LMP
Okay. NOUN 81, VY is +0004.1.

CAPCOM
Good readback. Let's press on with the checklist.

CDR
Okay. And Jack, find out about using TTCA to maneuver with.

CAPCOM
Okay. We're finished with the computer, it's yours. And we recommend using the TTCA to maneuver with.

CDR
Roger.

LMP
Okay, I'm back on the checklist, page 6, Jack. Under PGNS turn-on and self-test, we've done everything except the self-test here on this page. Do you want to do that at this time?

60:57:29
CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. Negative on the PGNS self-test. Page 7.

LMP
Okay. I'll scratch page 6. And on page 7, we're not going to activate the - or rather, we've had the S-BAND activated, ECS Activation I have all done. And at the bottom of the page, the docked IMU coarse align is done.

60:58:03
CAPCOM
Roger.

LMP
We've - okay, we've also completed, I guess in essence, all of page 8.

CAPCOM
That's affirmative, and page 9 to boot. Scratch VHF; we've done the T-ephems.

LMP
Okay, you've updated it, that's right. We cranked in the time.

CDR
And Houston, let's go to Activation - or get into page 10 and see what we do there.

CAPCOM
Okay. The only item on page 10 is to deploy the landing gear.

60:59:06
CDR
Okay. We'll do that now.

61:00:09
LMP
Okay. The landing gear are down and locked, Jack, and looking ahead now at page 11, we've done all of that.

CAPCOM
We verify that. Page 12.

LMP
Okay, and I assume in amongst all those numbers you pumped up, we got a REFSMMAT and STATE VECTOR, is that correct?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative. You've got that, so you can delete page 12.

LMP
Okay, on 13, you've read us up the fine align angles and we've cranked those in.

61:01:01
CAPCOM
Affirmative.

LMP
Okay, so now we're up to - we've got to do the DAP set, the gimbal/throttle test.

CAPCOM
That's -

CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. We recommend omitting the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test. Just make sure the gimbal - DECA POWER and DECA GIMBAL circuit breakers are closed.

LMP
Okay. We're going to proceed now with the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test, is that correct? Or did you say delete it?

CAPCOM
Aquarius, delete the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test. Just ensure that the DECA POWER and the DECA GIMBAL are closed.

CDR
Okay, Houston. DECA POWER is OPEN at this time. Do you want me to close it?

CAPCOM
Affirmative, Jim. Close the DECA POWER.

61:02:00
CDR
It's CLOSED. We deleted that.

LMP
Okay. Also out of that list, Jack, we need the COMMANDER'S THROTTLE set to THROTTLE and MIN.

LMP
Houston -

61:03:00
LMP
if I recall the launch set of the gimbals, the GDAs are not correct here, and where are we going to get those set for the burn?

CAPCOM
Standby.

CAPCOM
Okay, here's the word on the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test. Let's do step 1 and step 2, and that'll get our gimbal set.

61:04:20
LMP
Okay, Jack. We're going to have to back up on this if we're going to follow the procedure here, which has us go MODE CONTROL PGNS AUTO. We're going to have to pull the TCA breakers to keep from firing jets.

CAPCOM
Standby, Fred.

61:05:29
CAPCOM
Standby on step 1, Fred. We're getting the word for you.

CAPCOM
How do you like this sim?

CDR
It's a beauty.

61:06:10
CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius, we recommend you do the DAP set and gimbal/throttle test as per the checklist. Go PGNS AUTO and proceed.

CDR
Well, we're going to fire our thrusters as soon as we go to AUTO because we've got those thrusters in - the thruster circuit breakers. Do you want us to do that and stop?

CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius, we're recommending you go to AUTO, let the thrusters fire and settle down, and proceed with the test.

61:07:06
CDR
We're in PGNS AUTO.

CAPCOM
Roger. Your DAP is set, you're in wide deadband; that ought to do the trick.

CDR
Roger.

CAPCOM
Okay, we're looking at it, Aquarius; we're ready to proceed with the test.

LMP
Okay, we're proceeding.

LMP
Okay, and Houston, you -

LMP
- you're looking at the weights now. Those are still good, right?

61:08:01
CAPCOM
You're GO on the weights.

61:09:06
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to recycle on the DAP load and change your DAP to 32021. Over.

61:11:06
CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. We're looking at your gimbal and we notice that we've got a 4-jet ullage loaded in the DAP and we gave you 2 jets on the PAD. But let's go with what we've got loaded. It'll be a 4-jet ullage.

LMP
Okay.

LMP
Okay, Houston. How does the GDAs look now?

CAPCOM
The GDAs are GO as they are. Press on.

61:12:09
CDR
Okay, Houston. We're going to do the DPS pressurization and checkout.

CAPCOM
Standby 1.

CAPCOM
Okay, your gimbals are within 0.3 and we're ready for the DPS pressurization and checkout.

61:13:34
LMP
Okay, Houston. Do you want to follow up on page 15 with RCS checkout? In essence, we've kind of already done that.

CAPCOM
You're right, Aquarius. Let's delete the RCS checkout.

CAPCOM
And the DPS looks GO.

61:15:43
CDR
Houston, we're going to do a PGNS AUTO maneuver to the attitude.

CAPCOM
Standby on that.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, we recommend driving it around there manually with a TTCA.

CDR
Okay, we have to use the TTCA. Roger.

61:21:10
CDR
We're going to AUTO now, Houston, to try to damp the rates. We're at the attitude.

CAPCOM
Roger, Jim. We verify the attitude.

CDR
Roger.

61:23:37
LMP
And Houston, we'd like to confirm: do you want the VERB 65 ENTER in there?

CAPCOM
Affirmative on the VERB 65.

LMP
Okay.

61:24:12
LMP
Okay, Jack. I've got another question on page 18. At 1 minute, I concur with MASTER ARM ON, but I wonder why I have to have the ABORT STAGE breaker in.

LMP
We sure don't want any staging now.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, delete the ABORT STAGE circuit breaker CLOSE. Leave it OPEN.

LMP
Roger. Will delete.

LMP
Okay. Also, Jack, since we have 4-jet ullage versus 2, do you want - still want 10 seconds ullage or do you want 5 now?

61:25:09
CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius, we'll use automatic ullage.

LMP
Okay. We'll just let the 7.5 second AUTO ullage do it.

CAPCOM
Roger, and we'd like to do this in manual throttle, so on page 17 about two-thirds of the way down, THROTTLE CONTROL, MANUAL - vice AUTO.

LMP
Okay. We're set to MANUAL.

CDR
What's the 203 -

61:26:06
CAPCOM
ENTER on the 203, Jim.

CDR
We've got 203 on the DSKY now and it looks as though it requires work. Can we pass it?

CAPCOM
Aquarius, ENTER on the 203.

CDR
We hit ENTER.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, we'd like to verify that your throttle is in the MIN position.

CDR
That's affirm.

61:27:00
CAPCOM
And in the event that you have to do a manual takeover, turn the ENGINE GIMBAL OFF, MODE CONTROL to ATTITUDE HOLD, and use the hand contr - use the TTCA.

CDR
Roger.

61:28:14
LMP
Okay, 1 +30 to burn.

CAPCOM
Roger.

LMP
Okay. MASTER ARM's ON. 1 minute.

CAPCOM
Roger, Aquarius. You're GO for the burn.

61:29:55
CDR
40 percent.

61:30:04
CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. You're looking good.

CDR
AUTO SHUTDOWN.

LMP
Okay, you're looking at 16 85 now, Jack.

CAPCOM
Okay, you're GO on the residuals; proceed.

LMP
Okay, when you say GO on the residuals, you mean don't trim them. Is that right?

61:31:00
CAPCOM
That's affirmative. No trim required.

CDR
Roger.

61:32:18
CAPCOM
Aquarius, check your MASTER ARM OFF, please.

CDR
Okay, Houston. Burn's complete. Now we have to talk about powerdown, and what you want us to do with the PGNS.

CAPCOM
Roger. We're looking at that right now, and you'll be the first one to get the word.

61:33:19
CDR
And Houston, it's doubtful right now whether we'll be able to see the stars in this configuration. The only way we could possibly get alignment is with the Earth and the terminator or the Moon and its terminator and I'd sure like to have you look at a powerdown - keeping the PGNS if at all possible.

CAPCOM
Roger, Jim. We'll get the word for you.

61:35:25
CDR
And Houston, we're in an ATT HOLD mode. Can we turn off the thrusters?

CAPCOM
Standby on that one, Jim.

61:38:14
CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius. We're working on what's going to happen next. In the meantime, we'd like to take some high-power items off the line; so on panel 11, open DECA POWER and open DECA GIMBAL. On 16, open the ATCA breaker.

LMP
Okay. On 11, we've got DECA POWER, DECA GIMBAL OPEN. On 16, we've got the ATCA breaker OPEN.

61:39:38
CDR
And Houston, while you're thinking, see if you can come up with a procedure of perhaps using the Command Module optics with manual drive, if I have to look for stars.

CAPCOM
Roger.

61:41:24
CDR
And Jack, Aquarius. While you're thinking - before we had our COMM problems, we were wanting to know what to - whether we should hook up the side hatch urine dump system. So we wouldn't freeze up the normal urine dump feed.

CAPCOM
Roger. We gave you a GO on that earlier. Sorry, you must have missed it. Use the side hatch for urine dump.

CDR
Okay.

CAPCOM
And how are the stars out the window now?

61:42:13
CDR
Well, I'll look again, Jack, but at this attitude the Sun is reflecting off of - off of Quad 4 so bright that it's ruining any night vision. And we've still got particles floating around us. I'll have to take a long look and see if I can see any star patterns.

CAPCOM
Roger.

CAPCOM
And Aquarius, we're going to have to hand you over to a different site now, and we think maybe things will work better if this time we turn off the S-BAND TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER, and bring it back up in 5 minutes. You copy?

CDR
Okay, standby 1.

61:43:10
CDR
Okay, I understand you want us to turn off the S-BAND TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER and bring it up in 5 minutes. Is that correct?

CAPCOM
That's affirmative.

CDR
Tell us when.

CDR
And you want us to maintain attitude control?

CAPCOM
Affirmative on the attitude control.

CDR
That's AUTO attitude control. Okay. We'll maintain AUTO attitude control.

LMP
Okay, Jack. I'm back on the line now. On the S-BAND, you want me to turn off the TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER and the POWER AMPL to OFF for 5 minutes. Is that - when you give me the word - is that what you want?

61:44:10
CAPCOM
Aquarius, leave the POWER AMPLIFIER the way it is. Turn the TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER OFF for 5 minutes.

CAPCOM
Now.

LMP
Okay, you tell me - you tell me when.

CAPCOM
Okay, turn it off now. See you in 5 minutes.

LMP
Okay, it's gone off. It's gone off for 5 minutes.

61:51:05
LMP
- -

61:52:44
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

LMP
Okay, you're loud and clear there, Jack.

CAPCOM
Roger, same here. We're all - we're still discussing the next move.

61:53:04
LMP
I figured it. Let's just make it a good one.

CAPCOM
We're looking real close at water usage profiles, and right now things are kind of swinging toward leaving the IMU powered up and powering down the LGC. But we'll have more word for you shortly. And we recommend for sleeping that you leave one guy on watch. We recommend you don't make any urine dumps if you can help it, because it'll make the debris problem worse than it is now. And we have some items that you might want to transfer to the LM: some towels, some penlights, fecal bags, UTS. And do you have any more items that we can help you out with at the moment?

61:54:17
LMP
Okay. Stand by on your latter list there, Jack. I understand no urine dumps; I guess we'll work through the UCD and all the bags we got. And real quick there, can you give a DAP load that we want in here now to conserve the RCS?

61:55:21
CAPCOM
Okay. For attitude control, we're recommending manual control VERB 76 and watch your middle gimbal angle. Your DAP load that you have now looks good.

LMP
Okay, it's ATT HOLD VERB 76 for the guy on watch. And the DAP load we've got right now is okay.

61:58:18
CAPCOM
Aquarius, our decision for this time is to leave the IMU powered up, power down the LGC, and power down other nonessential items. We'll be coming up with a more precise checklist as soon as we can get it. Over.

LMP
Okay. The decision is to keep the platform, power down the computer, and we'll be standing by for further word on the powerdown, Jack.

CAPCOM
Roger.

61:59:33
CAPCOM
And Aquarius, for your information, we now have a 136 mile perigee.

CAPCOM
Confirmed by doppler.

LMP
Okay, 136 mile perigee now. That's very nice.

62:00:09
LMP
Oh. Wait a minute, Jack. Did you say pericynthion or perigee?

CAPCOM
I meant pericynthion.

LMP
That's better!

62:05:20
LMP
And Houston, we pulled out your UPDATA LINK circuit breaker, so if you want to update it for anything, let us know and we'll put it back in.

CAPCOM
Roger, Jim. We will.
